The main objective of the PRM is to monitor technical activities from the project stand point (progress  and issues), namely:    - Consolidation of data  - Monitor project risks and find solutions with the supplier,  - Review offshore activity / in situ resources status,  - Review and validate the supplier performance (OTD & OQD)   - Review Airbus inputs data to supplier (workload visibility & clarity of requirements).    TRM issues & risks can be inputs to the PRM. The PRM is managed on Monthly or Quarterly basis (maximum).    ** The Technical Review Meeting (TRM) scope is at the level of the Work Unit per catalogue and manages  short term activities & deliverables at the Engineer or Work-Package Leader level. The TRM consists of  operational reviews and detailed technical reviews to follow-up WU deliverables. It is managed on regular  basis, can be weekly.
